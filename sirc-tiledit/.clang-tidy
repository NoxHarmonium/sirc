CheckOptions:

# Reasons:
# cppcoreguidelines-owning-memory is disabled because it doesn't really fit with the memory model of QT where the caller doesn't own the widget
# cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-vararg can be useful sometimes, I'll try to use it sparingly
# bugprone-macro-parentheses because it will cause too many changes right now with all the guards for double header inclusion
# llvm-header-guard because I couldn't get auto fix to work and it is a pretty trivial rule
# readability-magic-numbers because sometimes magic numbers are more readable, and this isn't really something I need a machine to detect
