# VS Code support for the SIRC ecosystem

## Features

- Defines the SIRC flavour of assembly with the language ID 'sirc' and extension '.asm'
- Adds syntax highlighting for SIRC flavoured assembly
- Adds the ability to use VS Code to debug SIRC programs running in sirc-vm (when the `--debug` switch is used).

## Usage

It is not currently published anywhere, for the moment you will just have to open
this folder in VS Code and press F5 to run it.

After pressing F5 another instance of VS Code will open with the plugin activated
and you can open the SIRC example projects to see the syntax highlighting
and debugging.
